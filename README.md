This is my SQL personal project, the motivation of this project is to gain some knowledge about data cleaning in SQL and have some familiarity about querying in SQL. For each project/folder in this repository will consist of two main things, which are data cleaning and case study. In data cleaning section, this is pretty straightforward, we will clean our data that including remove duplicate rows, validate data type, validate input data, etc. While in case study section, we will answer some question based on the information provided by the table in order to gain some insights.
