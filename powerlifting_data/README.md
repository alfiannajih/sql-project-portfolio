# Documentation
This folder contains the documentation, datasets, query file, and some visualization graph.

For the sake of datasets availability in this repository, I just attach partial datasets that consists only 50 rows out of 2887199 rows from the original datasets because of the limitation of space. However I still use the original datasets for querying in this documentation.
